# Malware Detection Using Machine Learning
This repository contains the source code for detecting different type of malwares using Deep learning based Feature Extraction and Wraper based Feature Selection Technique. A research paper describing how it works is availible at "to be updated"

Two major approaches we used for malware classification:
1- Image representation of byte file
Independent of the platform
It requires No knowledge of domain like assembly instructions
2- Hybrid feature space using both ASM and byte file
This approach is platform dependent but gives a better performance that using byte file. Requires huge resources and processing time.



The data used in these tutorial can be found on the Hybrid(Final) folder of following drive link:

After downloading the required dataset, following is the sequence of files that will lead to resuts.

1. "Creating hybrid dataset"

2. "Min-max normalization(hybrid dataset)"

3. "ANN-Results"

The project was done under the guidance of Dr. Asifullah Khan, DCIS, PIEAS.

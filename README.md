# Malware Detection Using Machine Learning
This repository contains the source code for detecting different type of malwares using Deep learning based Feature Extraction and Wraper based Feature Selection Technique. A research paper describing how it works is availible at "to be updated"

Two major approaches we used for malware classification:
1- Image representation of byte file
Independent of the platform
It requires No knowledge of domain like assembly instructions
2- Hybrid feature space using both ASM and byte file
This approach is platform dependent but gives a better performance that using byte file. Requires huge resources and processing time

The project was done under the guidance of Dr. Asifullah Khan, DCIS, PIEAS.
